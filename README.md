#Isotonic position control
Mouses, trackpads are commonly used for position control. It provides accuracy to select objects on the screen because wherever you move the device, the point on the screen will stop according to the scale factor being applied.

#Isotonic rate control
Moving objects in the distance underwater reflect an isotonic rate control manipulation. Let's say you are holding a rigid but flexible 1 meter long wire from one side, with a ball attached to it on the other side. While underwater, every time you move your hand to move the ball on the other side, the ball will have a delay according to the resistance of the water and the flexibility of the wire. When your hand stops moving the force applied to the ball will keep it moving at a similar rate of its last input force. A similar thing, and even more accurate could happen in space where the there is near to null resistance and gravity forces.

#Isotonic acceleration control
Ice skating is an example of how an acceleration control works with isotonic input. Our speed will grow exponentially the more we keep adding force to our movement. In this case, skating faster. We will start at a slow speed and grow with the time, but the faster we get higher the force we need to stop our movement.

#Elastic position
The Claw game, or Crane game, use a joystick with Elastic position control to move in the z and x axis, and uses a button to drop the claw. The Claw will move at the same rate as the user push or pull the joystick, and when the user stops applying force to the joystick the claw will also stop its movement. Besides that, the elastic position control could be used in virtual environments to feel the pressure of objects being to pushed or pulled in the digital world.

#Elastic rate control
From a joystick or a spacemouse, elastic rate control is used to control cameras and ease its motion. This prevents unnecessary turbulence in the recorded image and the video will have smooth camera movements; pleasant for the viewers to watch.

<br/>

#Elastic acceleration control
In some old racing cars video games, a common manipulation is to accelerate the car pushing the joystick forward. Pulling it backward will slow does the speed until the car starts going backward.
